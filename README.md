With responsive design and the hamburger menu proving to be particularly challenging.

# Unfixed Bugs, issues and troubleshoots

A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) approach was taken towards the sites development, in order to avoid having unfixed bugs within the time alotted. Ts a result, a simplied approach was taken to the 'hamburger menu' for this project, which is absent of the functional X orginally intended for closing the menu when it is opened. Additionally a reduction in the total number of individually specified Media Queries was take, and limited to just two.

While some issues were observed with the IDE Application: Codeanywhere, such as connection time outs, preview delays between code modifications and change in site appearance during testing of pages. In addition a bug occuring when content is saved within the IDE Appliation (and not in GitHub) that produces an additional spacing, forward slash at specific points in the code. These were overcome by frequent github pushes.

Separately, an observed decoupling between CodeAnyWhere and Github, where code scripted in the IDE could not be pushed across despitee changes being present. This resulted in the creation of a New Workspace with the same Repository URL.

 
# Deployment

The site was deployed using GitHub pages, Clicking Settings, Selecting Pages, ensure Source was set to Main and Save. Once the site has refreshed a link will appear on the page, beside the text: "Your site is live at", which confirms successful deployment.
